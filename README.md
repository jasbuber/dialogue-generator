# Description

Online version : http://rpgdialogues.000webhostapp.com/

Dialogue generator is an application that allows to create and edit dialogue files that can be used in a game. It was created to improve the process of writing dialogues and decouple it from the actual game logic.
Every dialogue tree consists of a tree of items, representing a dialogue option that can be chosen by a player. 

**Dialogue item properties:**
* option - actual dialogue text that can be chosen
* response - a character response to that option
* actions - attributes that can be used to control conversation ( eg. trade, end conversation, go back, crossroads to go back to)
* conditions - determines conditional display of a dialogue tree eg. charisma > 15, strength > 10
